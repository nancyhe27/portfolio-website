  "overview": "In summer 2025, I interned as a UI/UX full stack developer intern at WeKruit, a SaaS startup building an AI-powered interview platform for enterprises and students. My role combined design and engineering, from mapping user flows to implementing full-stack features. Over 10 weeks, I contributed to the client-facing interview dashboard, the AI agent interview process, the WeKruit design system, and UI/UX refinements that transformed prototypes into a polished product. These efforts streamlined the review and preparation process for 1,000+ interviews across 3 client companies and enabled 100+ students to run mock sessions more smoothly.",

I mapped key user flows, created low-fidelity wireframes, and iterated on interactive prototypes to define how screens and features connect. Multiple rounds of feedback refined the prototypes into a clear, testable design.",

I not only deepened my technical and design abilities but also gained a clearer understanding of how teams balance user needs, business goals, and engineering constraints to bring a product to life. Working with mentors and peers challenged me to think critically, communicate more effectively, and take initiative when facing new problems. Most importantly, I leave this experience with a stronger sense of confidence in my abilities and a clearer direction for where I want to grow next."
