      number: 1,
      title: "Clinical Workflow Research",
      content: "Conducted contextual inquiries with 12 healthcare professionals across different specialties. Observed daily workflows, documented pain points with existing systems, and identified critical information needs. Discovered that physicians spend 40% of their time navigating between different software systems."
    },
    {
      number: 2,
      title: "Data Architecture & Prioritization",
      content: "Analyzed existing electronic health record systems and identified key data points for dashboard inclusion. Conducted card sorting exercises with medical staff to understand information hierarchy. Prioritized features based on clinical impact and frequency of use."
    },
    {
      number: 3,
      title: "Interface Design & Layout",
      content: "Designed dashboard layouts optimizing for quick information scanning and decision-making. Created modular interface components allowing customization for different medical specialties. Focused on clear visual hierarchy and reduced cognitive load through thoughtful information grouping."
    },
    {
      number: 4,
      title: "Data Visualization",
      content: "Developed specialized charts and graphs for medical data including trend lines for vital signs, medication timelines, and treatment progress indicators. Ensured all visualizations met healthcare accessibility standards and could be interpreted quickly during patient consultations."
    },
    {
      number: 5,
      title: "Usability & Safety Testing",
      content: "Conducted extensive usability testing with medical professionals using realistic patient scenarios. Tested for potential safety issues and information misinterpretation. Implemented safeguards and visual cues to prevent medical errors related to data misreading."
    },
    {
      number: 6,
      title: "Clinical Validation & Refinement",
      content: "Deployed prototype in controlled clinical environment with 25 healthcare professionals. Gathered feedback on workflow integration and clinical utility. Made final refinements based on real-world usage patterns and clinical feedback."
    }
  ],
  
  outcome: "MedDash reduced average patient information lookup time by 60% and increased physician satisfaction with data access by 75%. The dashboard improved clinical workflow efficiency and received approval for implementation across three major hospital systems."
