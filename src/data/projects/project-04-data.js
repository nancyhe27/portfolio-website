  description: "Architecture and engineering teams faced challenges in communicating complex 3D designs to clients and stakeholders. Traditional 2D plans and static 3D renders failed to convey spatial relationships effectively. ARVision bridges this gap through immersive AR visualization.",
  
  sprints: [
    {
      number: 1,
      title: "Industry Research & User Needs",
      content: "Conducted ethnographic research with architecture firms and engineering consultancies. Interviewed 18 professionals about current visualization methods and pain points. Identified key challenges: client comprehension of spatial concepts, design iteration communication, and on-site design validation."
    },
    {
      number: 2,
      title: "Technical Exploration & Prototyping",
      content: "Explored AR technology capabilities and limitations through rapid prototyping. Built proof-of-concept applications testing object tracking, lighting integration, and 3D model rendering. Established technical requirements and platform constraints for iOS and Android development."
    },
    {
      number: 3,
      title: "Interaction Design & Spatial UX",
      content: "Designed intuitive gestures and interactions for 3D object manipulation in AR space. Created spatial user interface elements that work effectively in augmented environments. Developed design patterns for AR-specific challenges like occlusion, lighting, and scale perception."
    },
    {
      number: 4,
      title: "User Interface Development",
      content: "Built comprehensive UI system combining traditional 2D interface elements with 3D spatial controls. Created tools for model loading, scaling, rotation, and annotation. Designed collaborative features allowing multiple users to view and interact with shared AR content."
    },
    {
      number: 5,
      title: "Field Testing & Iteration",
      content: "Conducted testing sessions at actual construction sites and client meetings with 8 architecture firms. Gathered feedback on practical usability, technical performance, and business value. Refined interaction models based on real-world usage scenarios."
    },
    {
      number: 6,
      title: "Professional Integration",
      content: "Developed integration workflows with popular CAD software and BIM tools. Created export processes and file format compatibility. Established best practices for AR model preparation and presentation techniques for professional use."
    }
  ],
  
  outcome: "ARVision significantly improved client understanding of design proposals, with 90% of users reporting better spatial comprehension compared to traditional methods. The tool reduced design revision cycles by 35% and improved client approval rates by 50%."
